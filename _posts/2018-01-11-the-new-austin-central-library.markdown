My friends and I spend a lot of time at the new Austin Central Library, one of the gorgeous, new buildings in town. Every time, I take photo after photo of the walls, windows, reflections, and its mysteries (more on this below). I threw my favorite photos into [CodePen](https://codepen.io/samkap/pen/BJmaor/) and tinkered with CSS `Grid` and responsive grid-columns ([if supported](https://caniuse.com/#search=grid)).
<p data-height="700" data-theme-id="light" data-slug-hash="BJmaor" data-default-tab="result" data-user="samkap" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="image-grid" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/samkap/pen/BJmaor/">image-grid</a> by samkap (<a href="https://codepen.io/samkap">@samkap</a>) on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

This Grid plays with a one- to three-column system. I'm getting used to the syntax, but I do like the column gap features, and think that could be handy in so many scenarios. Still CSS Grid feels like a bit of a mystery I yet have to do a deep dive.

One mystery I can say has been solve in the mysterious roof-top door that goes to nowhere. You can see this in the top left of the second photo. Last week, KUT got to the bottom of this mysterious door. [Check out the reveal](http://kut.org/post/whats-deal-doors-nowhere-new-austin-central-library) of why door goes to nowhere, and what it's for.
