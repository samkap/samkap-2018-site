Hi! I’m Sam Kapila. I’m a designer and educator living in Austin, TX. I write and speak about Responsive Web Design, Diversity and Inclusion in Tech, education involving emerging tech, and design research and process.

I’m a former Director of Academic Operations and Diversity, Director of Instruction, and Design Instructor at for-profit education and universities. I'm the [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/join/?kid=GDT52) City Organizer for Austin. I share my thoughts on the web in the documentary, [What Comes Next Is The Future](http://www.futureisnext.com/). I wrote for [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/sameera-kapila) (2015), a monthly column for [net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/author/sam-kapila) print and online for over two years, and for other publications, as well as served on [design competition juries](http://samkapila.com/writing-and-community/). 

I make [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/hamtequila) and travel a lot. I cook and dine out and [photograph](http://www.instagram.com/the_tableaux) it all. I grew up on the Dutch island of Curaçao, and lived in India, Florida, Greece, and South Carolina.
