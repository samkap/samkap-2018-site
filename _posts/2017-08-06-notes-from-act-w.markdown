- Relationships: vested, genuine, shared values
- in relationships: avoid the four horsemen: criticism, stonewalling, defensiveness, contemptâ€”sarcasm is a for of contempt/
- Engagement and flow
- purpose and meaning: why do we do what we do and our connection to the greater good.
- attainment: clear goals, measurable, resources, adaptability, and resilience.
- positive emotion
- five positive exchanges make up for one negative one to get a relationship back to neutral.

### Culture of Positive Emotional

- Honesty, then trust? Not in organizations
- Be honest, be vulnerable
- Transparency
- Process praise vs people praise
- Gratitude

> A good idea for mid-level managers is to post three good things that happened. Gratitude advances positive results. Do this in the morning, publicly.
