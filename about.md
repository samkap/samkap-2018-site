# Hi, I'm Sameera.

I was born in Bombay, grew up in Cura√ßao, and I live in Austin, TX. I am a Design Director at [thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com), a [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/join/?kid=GDT52) city organizer, and serve on two advisory boards for profit and non-profit organizations. I make [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/hamtequila) and travel a lot. I cook and I [photograph](http://www.instagram.com/the_tableaux) the process.

I am a designer and an educator. I formerly served as Instructional Director, Academic Operations Director, and Diversity Director, managing instructors and curriculum across 21 locations, a nation-wide scholarship and have helped start or run two diversity councils as ERGs.

I taught design at the university-level for over six years teaching courses from freshman year to seniors, and serving on multiple graduate thesis committees. I wrote the first university course on the topic of Responsive Web Design in 2011.

I share my thoughts on the web in the documentary, [What Comes Next Is The Future](http://www.futureisnext.com/). I wrote for [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/sameera-kapila) (2015, 2018), a monthly column for [net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/author/sam-kapila) print and online for over two years, and for other publications, as well as served on [design competition juries](http://samkapila.com/writing-and-community/). I write and speak about Responsive Web Design, diversity, inclusion, and equity, tech education involving emerging tech, and design research and process.
