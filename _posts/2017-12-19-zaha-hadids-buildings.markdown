Thinking about this Zaha Hadid building near the New York Highline in West Chelsea. Saw in while on a 10\+ yrs reunion trip in friends from college. It's a residence, and her last building in New York. It reminds me of The Jetsons and Interstellar (in a time-bending sort of way) at the same time, and not at all of hours spent playing SimCity2000. I was reminded that I took this photo after reading about [Hadid on Wallpaper Magazine](https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/zaha-hadid) via a link from [Swiss-Miss](https://www.wallpaper.com/tags/zaha-hadid).
