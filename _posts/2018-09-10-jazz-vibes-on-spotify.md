There is a [Jazz playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/37i9dQZF1DX0SM0LYsmbMT?si=6tzalt14TwisRU6xUpa2mA) that I've repeatedly played the last few weeks. It's really nice while coding or designing, and its even lovelier in the evening with low lights and [hygge](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-year-of-hygge-the-danish-obsession-with-getting-cozy). The list is updated weekly by Spotify which makes it even better. Check it out.
