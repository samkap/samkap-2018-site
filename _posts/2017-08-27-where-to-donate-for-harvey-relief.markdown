Houston has seen 22in+ with more expectation and surrounding areas like Austin have seen 4-9in. I'm seeing a lot of great tweets about where to donate, so I thought I'd share a list here of what I've come across or donated to thus far.

- [American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/donate/hurricane-harvey?campname=Harvey&campmedium=aspot). I know there are some articles on Twitter going around about this, but in Texas we're seeing them feed displaced families and individuals. Please help. It's easy.
- [Texas Diaper Bank](texasdiaperbank.org/)
- [SPCA of Texas](http://spca.org/give)
- [Austin Pet Alive!](https://www.austinpetsalive.org/hurricane-harvey-evacuations/). Their site seems to be having high traffic outages, so [this is an alternative for APA!](https://t.co/pGfccAoGQe).
- [Houston Food Bank](http://www.houstonfoodbank.org/donate/donate-money/)
- [Portlight](http://portlight.org). Disaster relief for disabled people
- [Houston Coalition for the Homeless](https://www.homelesshouston.org/take-action/donate/)
- [Salvation Army Austin](https://give.salvationarmyusa.org/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app340b?df_id=27651&mfc_pref=T&27651.donation=form1&NONCE_TOKEN=09144B4DDAFD7687A8B0C5937B421EC6)
- [Convenant House](https://www.covenanthouse.org/donation-options/donate-now). They've got about 70 homeless youth to feed so far.
- [Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/)
- And finally, multiple [GoFundMe accounts raising funds](https://www.gofundme.com/hurricaneharvey)
