		<p>Hi! I’m Sam Kapila. I’m a designer, educator, and person living in Austin, TX with two cats and a lot of coffee. I’m the Director of Academic Operations & Diversity at <a href="http://theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a>.

I am constantly tinkering with responsive web design, web typography, podcasting, writing, speaking about design, and cooking. I grew up on the Dutch island of <a href="http://www.curacao.com">Curaçao</a>, and lived in India, Florida, Greece, and South Carolina. </p>
