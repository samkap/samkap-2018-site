On Monday, I attended the BookPeople book launch for artist and poet Cleo Wade's "Heart Talk", which released in the first week of March. I subscribe to BookPeople's email list, and was excited that a person I follow on Instagram was coming to my town. I was so excited I didn't even realize this would take place during the tenth SXSW in this city since I moved to Texas.

In addition to hearing Cleo speak, she was joined by her friend, Elaine Welteroth, who many of us know as the first African American Editor-in-Chief at Teen Vogue, helping reshape the magazine into one that covered women's rights and the rights of those frequently marginalized. She also holds the other barrier-breaking title of the youngest editor Conde Nast has ever seen. 

Many people showed up early and secured good seats, and I was one of those people. It's probably the earliest I've ever shown up for anything, coming in at about 90 minutes before the event was scheduled to begin. Immediately, the others who came in, mostly women and women of color at that, started talking to each other and complimenting each other. One woman, named Fontaine, helped set the friendly tone. She was visiting from DC, and she spoke to everyone around her. Her friendly nature opened up the rest of us. We were cracking jokes, sharing our interest in the conversation coming towards us, and sharing where we purchased our coats on this windy, cloudy day. A man I met, wearing a full-sleeve shirt designed with graphics and words from Solange's Seat at the table brought gcopies of activity books based on some of her lyrics as a gift to both the speakers we were about to see. A open-minded father accompanied his teenage daughter, and I watched his expression go from happy to experience this with his daughter to completely in awe that his daughter and him got to share the energy of the room and the two women.

They came down the stairs, and popped out from behind the curtains. We all waved and smiled, ready for the Instagram stories and boomerangs that we knew Elaine would be capturing. We nudged each other to gasp in unison at Cleo's shiny heels. We adored that they both wore black berets with their hair down; they were put together and laid back in their own skin, and we felt it, too.

Cleo shared a poem titled "A love_____".
