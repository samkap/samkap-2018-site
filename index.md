Hi! I’m Sameera, and I'm from Curaçao and I live in Austin, TX. I am a Design Director at [thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com), a [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/join/?kid=GDT52) city organizer, and serve on two advisory boards for profit and non-profit organizations.

I enjoy making [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/hamtequila), traveling, and cooking which I [photograph](http://www.instagram.com/the_tableaux).

who formerly served as Instructional and Academic Operations as well as Diversity, managing a national-wide scholarship and leading a diversity council. I taught design at the university-level for over six years teaching courses from freshman year to seniors, and serving on multiple graduate thesis committees. I wrote the first university course on the topic of Responsive Web Design in 2011.

I share my thoughts on the web in the documentary, [What Comes Next Is The Future](http://www.futureisnext.com/).
