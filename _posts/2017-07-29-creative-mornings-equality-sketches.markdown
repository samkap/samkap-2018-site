Last Friday, I spoke at [Creative Mornings](https://creativemornings.com/talks/sam-kapila) in Austin about their monthly, global theme, “equality”. Here are some AWESOME sketches from the talk, by artist, [Ami Plasse](http://amidrawstx.tumblr.com/post/163541590683/creativemorningsaustin-72117-on-the-topic-of).
