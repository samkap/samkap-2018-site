Hi! I’m Sameera. I’m a designer and educator living in Austin, TX. I grew up on the Dutch island of Curaçao. I am a designer at [thoughtbot](http://www.thoughtbot.com),a [Tech Ladies](https://www.hiretechladies.com/join/?kid=GDT52) city organizer and serve on two advisory boards for profit and non-profit organizations. I make [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/hamtequila) and travel a lot. I cook and dine out and [photograph](http://www.instagram.com/the_tableaux) it all. 

I’m a former Director of Academic Operations and Diversity, Director of Instruction, and Design Instructor at for-profit coding education and state universities. 

I share my thoughts on the web in the documentary, [What Comes Next Is The Future](http://www.futureisnext.com/). I wrote for [The Pastry Box Project](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/sameera-kapila) (2015, 2018), a monthly column for [net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/author/sam-kapila) print and online for over two years, and for other publications, as well as served on [design competition juries](http://samkapila.com/writing-and-community/). I write and speak about Responsive Web Design, Diversity and Inclusion in Tech, education involving emerging tech, and design research and process.
