Today, Greg was sharing an issue he was having with Jekyll installs and builds. I thought was something tied to Bundler or Jekyll 3.0 issues I've had in the past, but Ethan figured out that the `_site` folder wasn't building correctly and that a pretty awesome solution is working around the gem-based themes. This site is built on Jekyll, but I want tinker with this more on a new project, rather than mess with this one. Check out the Twitter conversation and Ethan's helpful suggestions below. I'm bookmarking this here for myself and anyone else who adores Jekyll.

And then Uncle Dave pops in and teaches us all how to start a new Jekyll project sans-theme at all. Where has this been my entire Jekyll-using life?
