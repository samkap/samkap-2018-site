Recently, \[Shop Talk Show\](https://www.shoptalkshow.com) came out with a mini series on "How to think liek a front-end developer" While I may not consider myself one, I was honored to be asked, and we spent a lovely and hilarious hour talking about job titles, expectations, education, the way we work at \[thoughtbot\](https://www.thoughtbot.com), and a rapid fire chat about various Dribbble shots. 

Check out the [episode](https://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/335/)!
