I find myself thinking about skin a lot lately. Not in a creepy movie sort of way, but just about it in general. It's the heaviest organ, so why not think about it every once in a while. I think a lot about being comfortable in my skin, how much the world in 2017 aged my skin, and about representation of skin.
