Houston has seen 22in+ with more expectation and surrounding areas like Austin have seen 4-9in. I'm seeing a lot of great tweets about where to donate, so I thought I'd share a list here of what I've come across or donated to thus far.

### General
- **[American Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/donate/hurricane-harvey?campname=Harvey&campmedium=aspot).** I know there are some articles on Twitter going around about this, but in Texas we're seeing them feed displaced families and individuals. Please help. It's easy.
- **[Salvation Army Austin](https://give.salvationarmyusa.org/site/Donation2;jsessionid=00000000.app340b?df_id=27651&mfc_pref=T&27651.donation=form1&NONCE_TOKEN=09144B4DDAFD7687A8B0C5937B421EC6)**

- **[SPCA of Texas](http://spca.org/give)**
- **[Austin Pet Alive!](https://www.austinpetsalive.org/hurricane-harvey-evacuations/).** Their site seems to be having high traffic outages, so [this is an alternative for APA!](https://t.co/pGfccAoGQe). And you can donate directly to their [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/E82TAHUQLYW8/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_ws_o.dOzb4M9214S).

### For the disabled

### For the homeless
- **[Houston Coalition for the Homeless](https://www.homelesshouston.org/take-action/donate/)**
- **[Covenant House](https://www.covenanthouse.org/donation-options/donate-now)**. They've got about 70 homeless youth to feed so far.

### Financial Support and Attorneys for Disaster Relief
- **[State Bar of Texas](https://www.texasbar.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Disaster_Relief_Resources1&Template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&ContentID=29730)**. Came across [this in a status update on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/ivan.turingan/posts/1649329761766524) on why legal help is needed.
- **[Operation Hope](https://www.operationhope.org/hope-coalition-america). They have free financial services for Harvey victims
