Over the last few months, my friends and I spent time in the new Austin Central Library, one of the gorgeous buildings in town. Every time I'm there, I'm taking photo after photo of the walls, windows, reflections, and its mysteries (more on this shortly). Here are some of the ones I've taken so far, which gives me to perfect excuse to tinker with CSS `Grid` and responsive grid-columns ([if it's supported](https://caniuse.com/#search=grid)).
