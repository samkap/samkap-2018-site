In the late Spring of 2016, my TIY colleague Jessica (now CEO and co-founder of [Momentum Learning](http://www.momentumlearn.com/) in the Research Triangle) worked on another project together, like we had been for years, remotely, and on trains, planes, and automobiles. Jessica came to me with the idea of starting an internal Diversity Council. For weeks we worked through what our council could look like and do, why we felt it was important to start one, and what we'd hope to achieve. 

In March, we had visited the White House, to pledge our participation in The Opportunity Project ([White House Fact Sheet](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/07/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-opportunity-project-utilizing-open-data)), a project that brought together groups and organizations, large and small, private and government, to share their data openly, so new civic apps and tools built using these data sets and APIs could help create opportunities through overlaying data that had never been shared before. This was an eye-opening event that paralleled  conversations in the tech community around diversity and inclusion, gender disparities, ethics in tech, pay gaps, and inequality for minorities or the LGBTQIA community
