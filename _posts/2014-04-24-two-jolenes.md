desc: The various versions of a song I’ve had stuck in my head all week

Earlier this week, Austin-based designer [Reagan Ray](https://twitter.com/raygunray/status/458647623784611841) shared a video of Dolly Parton’s “Jolene” at 33rpm. I’ve been listening to it since. It’s slow, sad, and lovely.

Another version of “Jolene” I really enjoy comes from Miley Cyrus’ backyard sessions from 2012. Both versions give me chills.
