Hi! I’m Sam Kapila. I’m a designer and educator living in Austin, TX. I write and speak about Responsive Web Design, Diversity and Inclusion in Tech, and design research and process.

I’m currently the Director of Academic Operations and Diversity at [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com) and looking for opportunities starting October 2017. I'm a former contributor to a monthly column for [net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/search?searchTerm=kapila) print and online, and share my thoughts on the web in the documentary, [What Comes Next Is The Future](http://www.futureisnext.com/).

I make a lot of [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/hamtequila">playlists) and travel a lot. I cook and dine out and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/the_tableaux">photograph</a> it all. I grew up on the Dutch island of Curaçao, and lived in India, Florida, Greece, and South Carolina.
