My friend Jesse just shared the most amazing resource, called [Git Flight Rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules), a resourceful repository about what to do when things don't go as planned with Git. One of my favorites so far is the "[I committed with the wrong name and email configured](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules#i-committed-with-the-wrong-name-and-email-configured)".
