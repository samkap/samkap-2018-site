### REMAP
- Relationships: vested, genuine, shared values
- in relationships: avoid the four horsemen: criticism, stonewalling, defensiveness, contempt—sarcasm is a for of contempt/
- Engagement and flow
- purpose and meaning: why do we do what we do and our connection to the greater good.
- attainment: clear goals, measurable, resources, adaptability, and resilience.
- positive emotion
- five positive exchanges make up for one negative one to get a relationship back to neutral.

### Culture of Positive Emotional
- Trust-building
- Honesty, then trust? Not in organizations
- Be honest, be vulnerable
- Transparency
- Process praise vs people praise
- Gratitude
- 3 Good things
- Wonderment board
- Journaling
- Mindfulness
- Best possible future self

> A good idea for mid-level managers is to post three good things that happened. Gratitude advances positive results. Do this in the morning, publicly.

### Purpose and Meaning in practice
- Purpose and meaning, defined
- affirm and reward pro-social efforts
- build cross-departmental collaboration
- altruism: help because you can
- challenge transactional thinking—no quid pro quo

### Positive Emotion
- Positive primers increases resistance to negativity
- priming helps us connect to positive outcomes
- primers help activate our memory
- primers help achieve focus
- how can we use positive primers in our relationships and on our teams?

### Skills
- lynda, udacity, coursera, local meetups, orgs, tech book clubs, slack channels, create your own learning community at work, majority of people do not use their education allowance/benefit at work.

### Dora Milaje
- Dora Milaje, from _Black Panther_ : not just mentors or sponsors, but also *peers*
- they don't have to be older than you
- they don't have to be in your industry
- should be a mutually beneficial relationship
- stand up for each other, speak up in meetings
- vent/safe space
- share tips that helps, do retros on what didn’t
- celebrate your Dora Milaje’s accomplishments!
- help each other gain more visibility (at work, in the community, within each others’ network)

### what is this hype (things are are no bueno)
- remote work is a must. I am currently working from the beach in my flip flops and you're not. LOL see you on insta.
- really love to work. I feel so bad for people who dread Mondays. workaholics are so mis-understood
- free lunches : they want u to stay there
- failure is amaze.
- entrepreneurship is for the most special amazing people ever. 


- Cassandra Anderson: focus
- *Negosh the sitch*: She-Hulk, lawyer, tactical strategy, handles stress well, her flight instinct doesn’t kick in.
