Hi! I’m Sam Kapila. I’m a designer and educator living in Austin, TX. I write and speak about Responsive Web Design, Diversity and Inclusion in Tech, and design research and process. I’m the Director of Academic Operations and Diversity at <a href="http://www.theironyard.com">The Iron Yard</a> and I write a column for <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/search?searchTerm=kapila">net magazine</a>. I make a lot of <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/hamtequila">playlists</a> and travel a lot. I cook a lot and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/the_tableaux">photograph</a> it.
