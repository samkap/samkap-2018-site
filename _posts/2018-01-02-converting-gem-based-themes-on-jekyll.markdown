Today, Greg was sharing an issue he was having with Jekyll installs and builds. I thought was something tied to Bundler or Jekyll 3.0 issues I've had in the past, but Ethan figured out that the `_site` folder wasn't building correctly and that a pretty awesome solution is working around the gem-based themes. This site is built on Jekyll, but I want tinker with this more on a new project, rather than mess with this one. Check out the Twitter conversation and Ethan's helpful suggestions below. I'm bookmarking this here for myself and anyone else who adores Jekyll.

Iâ€™ve installed all of the things required in the getting started doc and confirmed they are recent versions.<br><br>What am I doing wrong? <a href="https://t.co/sqoyhb97Cc">pic.twitter.com/sqoyhb97Cc</a></p>&mdash; Greg Storey (@Brilliantcrank) <a href="https://twitter.com/Brilliantcrank/status/948284261362216960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2018</a></blockquote>
