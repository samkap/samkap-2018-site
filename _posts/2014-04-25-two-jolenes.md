Earlier this week, Austin-based designer [Reagan Ray](https://twitter.com/raygunray/status/458647623784611841) shared a video of Dolly Parton’s “Jolene”at 33rpm. I’ve been listening to it since. It’s slow, sad, and lovely.

Another version of “Jolene” I really enjoy comes from Miley Cyrus’ backyard sessions from 2012.

Both versions give me chills.
