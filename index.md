Hi! I’m Sam Kapila. I’m a designer and educator living in Austin, TX. I write and speak about Responsive Web Design, Diversity and Inclusion in Tech, and design research and process. 

I’m the Director of Academic Operations and Diversity at [The Iron Yard](http://www.theironyard.com) and I write a column for [net magazine](http://www.creativebloq.com/search?searchTerm=kapila). I make a lot of [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/user/hamtequila">playlists) and travel a lot. I cook and dine out and <a href="http://www.instagram.com/the_tableaux">photograph</a> it all.
